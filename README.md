# Focus-group-control

This repo contains code discussed during BIASlab's focus group meeting on Active Inference controllers in ReactiveMP.jl. 

We will generate demonstrations for various classical and project-related control systems, among which:

- Bayesian thermostat
- Mountain car
- Single pendulum
- CartPole
- Acrobot

More to come.
